What designates the events we will experience? Or how do we decide who we belong to? Answers to existential questions like this used to depend heavily on external variables like geography. Conditions defined who and what we were exposed to. But today, our lives have been mostly digitalized, so did the platforms we socialize on and resources we fed from. Now, we perceive the world through customized feeds. Which are being shaped by algorithms based on our previous actions. This, creates a centrifugal force that pushes each of us to extremes by solidifying and amplifying our own perspectives with feedback loops. We built echo chambers for our perceptions. FeedsofOthers is a web platform that aims to be an antidote for these effects of social media by bringing “the others” back to our feeds. https://youtu.be/6TR4fcUUnP8
